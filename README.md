# NASA SPACE APPS HACKATHON: Team Alpha Clan

An international 36hr hackathon that invites students and developers from anywhere in the world to solve the pressing issues faced in the world today. 


# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In 2015, the United Nations created the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals [SDG] Agendaâ€”a set of 17 goals focused on addressing global concerns such as climate change, global poverty, pollution, inequality, and many more. As we embark on the halfway point of the SDG Agenda, we aim to find new ways to engage youth with the tools available to advance these goals and measure our progress in achieving them. Your challenge is to develop a lesson plan that educates high school students about an SDG, and can be integrated into a science unit that may already be part of the curriculum [e.g., a unit on weather, geology, soil health, etc.].


# OUR SOLUTION:

We designed a lesson plan that engaged students outside the classroom rather than inside. Due to the rising use of social media and other apps, students have had a decreased attention span. This makes it difficult for them to focus and see the meaning in what they are being taught. Our lesson plan is not just only hands on, but offers an interactive game that allows students to practice making the right choices from the start - once they wake up, once they reach school and on the way back. 

A simple game to help high school students understand the choices they can make to ensure the growth and development of our world! We incorporated this game into our lesson plan for grades 8-10. 

At the end of the day, we hope that by influencing the young of today, we can influence the young of tomorrow to lead sustainable and climate friendly life styles.
