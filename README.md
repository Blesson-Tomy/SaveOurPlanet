# Smart India Hackathon 2024 (Prelims): Data download Duplication Alert System (DDAS)

The Smart India Hackathon is conducted by the Government of India as part of a large scale invitation to solve the various problems faced by companies and government institutions across the country. It is an annual event with a prelims round conducted by local institutes and then a national round for those who qualify for the prelims round.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:


# OUR SOLUTION:

Our solution is to develop an extension for the browsers. This extension will read the metadata of the downloaded files and store them using a Hashmap. The key and it's values will be checked when another download is triggered. If a duplicate exists in Hashmap, then the user will be prompted to confirm download. Else, the download is executed. There is a button feature implemented to clear the hashmap when necessary.
